	<b>Varanasi</b>-
		Varanasi is one of the most beautiful, historical and spiritual cities in Northern India. The first settlements date back to the 11th century BC, making it one of the oldest inhabited places in the world.<br> It is a sacred place to both Hindus and Jains. Varanasi is also home to a varied range of vendors, sadhus, entrepreneurs, priests, pilgrims and families. <br>What brings them together is their deference and dependence to the stunning river Ganga. The scenes of devotion that travelers can witness in the river set against the backdrop of some of the most stunning temples, especially at sunrise, are certainly some of the most impressive in the world.<br>

	
	<b>Bangalore</b>-
		In one of the latest surveys, Bangalore was established as India’s most livable city. In the past, it used to be referred to as the ‘Pensioner’s Paradise’ and the ‘Garden City of India’ because of the large green spaces available across the city. The city has now developed and become a much larger and cosmopolitan city with less green spaces as a consequence.<br> However, it still has enough to make it one of the most beautiful cities in India. Moreover, lush green forests are still to be found in the outskirts. Bangalore is also the main center of the IT industry, commonly known as the ‘Silicon Valley of India’.<br>

	<b>Delhi</b>-
		It is true that Delhi is the capital of India, home to the executive, judiciary and legislative branches of the Government. But Delhi is much more than that.<br> It is a cultural hub – a large metropolis with many arts and culture-related activities to offer. It is also a center for fashion and gastronomy. Travelers can head there for the best dining experiences and nightlife, but also for sightseeing as the city is home to some of the most stunning temples, mosques and forts.<br> These include the Red Fort, Jama Masjid and the Baha’i Lotus Temple.
